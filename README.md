 📈 Algorithmic Trading Backtester: Dual Moving Average Crossover

This project is a Python-based quantitative backtesting solution designed to evaluate the performance of a classic trend-following strategy against historical market data.

It serves as a strong foundation for building more complex trading systems by demonstrating key concepts like signal generation, vectorization, and equity curve analysis.

## ✨ Key Technologies & Libraries

| Library | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python 3.x** | Core language for development. |
| **Pandas** | High-performance data manipulation and time-series analysis (vectorization). |
| **yfinance** | Access to free, reliable historical stock price data. |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computation for efficient signal processing. |
| **Matplotlib** | Generating clear, professional performance charts and visualizations. |

## 🧠 Strategy Logic (50 / 200 SMA Crossover)

The strategy is a simple, long-only, trend-following model designed to capture large directional moves while minimizing exposure during extended consolidation or bear markets.

* **Target Asset:** Apple Inc. (Ticker: `AAPL`)
* **Timeframe:** Daily candles (`D`)
* **Entry Signal (Go Long):** The **Fast SMA (50 periods)** crosses **ABOVE** the **Slow SMA (200 periods)**.
* **Exit Signal (Go Flat):** The **Fast SMA (50 periods)** crosses **BELOW** the **Slow SMA (200 periods)**.

## 📊 Backtest Results Summary

The strategy was tested on the period from 2015-01-01 to 2025-01-01.

| Metric | Buy & Hold (Benchmark) | Strategy Performance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cumulative Return** | [INSERT AAPL RETURN]% | [INSERT STRATEGY RETURN]% |
| **Max Drawdown** | [INSERT B&H DRAWDOWN]% | [INSERT STRATEGY DRAWDOWN]% |
| **Final Value (Starting with 1.0)** | [INSERT B&H FINAL VALUE] | [INSERT STRATEGY FINAL VALUE] |

### Key Takeaway:
*If the strategy return is lower:* While the strategy underperformed the benchmark over this aggressive bull period, it significantly **reduced maximum drawdown** by avoiding the major market correction in [Identify a major crash year, e.g., 2020].

*If the strategy return is higher:* The strategy successfully identified and held the most profitable trends, leading to a [X]% alpha generation compared to passively holding the asset.

## ⚙️ Setup and Execution

To run this backtest on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-REPO-NAME].git
    cd [YOUR-REPO-NAME]
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Execute the Script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* **Risk Management:** Implement dynamic stop-loss and take-profit targets (e.g., based on ATR).
* **Optimization:** Create a function to test all combinations of short/long windows to find the optimal pair.
* **Execution Integration:** Adapt the code to use the `ccxt` library for live paper trading via an exchange API.
